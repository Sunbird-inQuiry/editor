## STEPS TO USE SUNBIRD-QUESTIONSET-EDITOR AS WEB-COMPONENT IN VANILLA JAVASCRIPT


- Copy files from the `https://github.com/Sunbird-inQuiry/editor/tree/release-5.7.0/web-component` to the root of this vanilla javascript project

- Editor is making API call for question and questionset create/update for that it requires backend services. For running the editor from `localhost:3000` pointing to any end point refer the [server.js](https://github.com/Sunbird-inQuiry/editor/blob/release-5.7.0/server.js) file and run it using `node server.js`
